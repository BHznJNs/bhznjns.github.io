# 热力学基础

## 温度 | Temperature

### 计量单位 | Scales

- Celsius scale
- Fahrenheit scale
- Kelvin scale
- Rankine scale

## 第零定律 | Zeroth Law of Thermodynamic

If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

## 过程与循环 | Processes and Cycle

- Any change that a system undergoes from one equilibrium state to another is called a process.
- A series of states through which a system passes during a process is called the path.
- A system is said to have undergone a cycle if it returns to its initial state at the end of the process.

### 一些常见过程别称

- Constant temperature process - ##Isothermal## process
- Constant pressure process - ##Isobaric## process
- Constant volume process - ##Isometric## process or ##isochoric## process
- Adiabatic Process - no heat is transferred.
  - If the process happens so quickly that there is no time to transfer heat,
  - or If a system is very well insulated from its surroundings.
- Polytropic process - occurs with an interchange of both heat and work between the inside and outside.

## 系统与边界 | Systems and Boundary

- System: a quantity of matter or a region in space chosen for study.
- Surrounding: the mass or region outside the system.
- Boundary: the real or imaginary surface that separates the system
from its surroundings.

## 理想气体法则 | Ideal Gas Laws

### Boyle’s Law (1662)

``P1 * V1`` = ``P2 * V2`` Constant ##temperature##

### Charles' law (1780) (Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802)

``V1 / T1`` = ``V2 / T2`` Constant ##pressure##

### Combined ideal gas law

``P1 * V1 / T1`` = ``P2 * V2 / T2``

``PV`` = ``mRT``
