# 蒸汽性质 | Properties of Vapours

## 物质形态 | Phases of Pure Substances

Substances normally exist in different phases: ##solid##, ##liquid## and ##gas##.
1. Liquid state
2. A liquid that is about to vaporize is called a ##saturated liquid##
3. A saturated liquid–vapour mixture since the liquid and vapour phases coexist in ##equilibrium##
4. A vapour that is about to condense(凝结) is called a ##saturated vapour##
5. A vapour that is not about to condense is called a ##superheated vapour##

1. 饱和液体 - 将要蒸发的液体 -- ##saturated liquid##
2. 饱和气体 - 将要凝结的蒸汽 -- ##saturated vapour##
3. 过热气体 - 不将要凝结的蒸汽 -- ##superheated vapour##

- Saturated liquid–vapour mixture (State 3)
- Saturated vapour (state 4): A vapour that is about to condense
- Superheated vapour (state 5): A vapour that is not about to condense

Saturation temperature: At a given pressure, the temperature at which a substance changes phase T,,sat,,
Saturation pressure: At a given temperature, the pressure at which a substance changes phase p,,sat,,

## 蒸汽相关概念 | Vapour related phrases

- Gas: a state of matter (solid, liquid, gas, plasma)
- Vapour: substance in gas state, it can be condensed to liquid
- Steam: water vapour
- Moisture: presence of a liquid (often water) in trace amount

## 潜热 | Latent heat

Latent heat: The amount of energy absorbed or released during a phase-change process
在温度保持不变的条件下，物质在从某一个相转变为另一个相的相变过程中所吸入或放出的热量。

##零界点 (Critical point)## - the point at which the saturated liquid and saturated vapour states are identical.

## 三相点 | Triple point

At triple-point pressure and temperature, a substance exists in three phases in equilibrium.

## 升华 | Sublimation

物体由固体无需融化直接转变为气体 | Solids evaporates directly without melting first.

## 液体与蒸汽状态的焓 | Enthalpy of saturated liquid and saturated vapour states

h = u + pv

``f``: for saturated liquid
``g``: for saturated vapour
``fg``: for difference between the saturated vapour and saturated liquid values of the same property

v,,f,,: specific volume of saturated liquid
v,,g,,: specific volume of saturated vapour
v,,fg,,: difference between v,,g,, and v,,f,, that is, v,,fg,, = v,,g,, – v,,f,,
h,,fg,,: enthalpy of vaporization (or latent heat of vaporization), represents the amount of energy needed to vaporize a unit mass of saturated liquid at a given temperature or pressure.

### 超临界流体 | Supercritical fluid

- any substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point, where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist.
- can effuse(喷出) through solids like a gas, and dissolve(溶解) materials like a liquid.

## 饱和气液混合物 | Saturated Liquid–Vapour Mixture

Define quality ``x`` as the ##ratio## of the mass of ##vapour## to the ##total## mass of the mixture.

Quality x = m,,vapour,, / m,,total,,

v,,avg,, = (1 - x)v,,f,, + xv,,g,,
或者：
v,,avg,, = v,,f,, - xv,,f,, + xv,,g,, = v,,f,, + xv,,fg,, where v,,fg,, = v,,g,, - v,,f,,

Quality x = (v,,avg,, - v,,f,,) / v,,fg,,

同样地，对于内能、焓和熵，也有：

x = (u,,avg,, - u,,f,,) / u,,fg,,
x = (h,,avg,, - h,,f,,) / h,,fg,,
x = (s,,avg,, - s,,f,,) / s,,fg,,

## 湿度 | Humidity

Absolute humidity | specific humidity | humidity ratio:

单位质量干燥空气中存在水蒸气的质量。

![绝对湿度公式](.蒸汽性质/绝对湿度公式.png)
where R,,a,, = 0.287 kJ/kgK, R,,v,, = 0.462 kJ/kgK

饱和状态下的绝对湿度为当前温度下所能达到的最大湿度。

Relative humidity:

空气中实际水蒸气的质量与饱和状态下所能容纳的水蒸气质量之比。

![相对湿度公式](.蒸汽性质/相对湿度公式.png)
where p,,g,, is p saturated at T.

The amount of moisture air can hold is proportional to the saturation pressure, which increases with temperature. Air can hold more moisture at higher temperatures.

## 蒸汽压强 | Vapour pressure

p,,atm,, = p,,a,, + p,,v,,

pv = ϕp,,sat @T,,
where p,,sat @T,, is the saturation pressure of water at the specified temperature.

## 水暴露于空气的标准相平衡 | Phase equilibrium criterion for water exposed to air

当环境湿度达到 100%，空气饱和，于是此时不存在从液态到气态的相变，并且这两种物态达到##平衡##。
When the environment relative humidity is 100% , the air is saturated, there is no transformation from the liquid phase to the vapour phase, and the two phases are in ##phase equilibrium##.

对于暴露于空气的液态水而言，标准相平衡则为：##空气中的蒸汽压强与水温下水的饱和压强相等##。
For liquid water that is open to the atmosphere, the criterion for phase equilibrium is: ##the vapour pressure in the air must be equal to the saturation pressure of water at the water temperature##.

p,,v,, = p,,sat @T,,

- Drying condition
- Fog and dew
- Clouds
- Rainfall
- Cold front
- Supercooling
- Snow
