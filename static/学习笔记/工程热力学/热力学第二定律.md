# 热力学第二定律 | Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics asserts that processes occur in a certain direction and that energy has quality as well as quantity.

## 热机 | Heat Engines

Converting ##heat to work## requires special devices called heat engines.

- ##receive heat## from a high temperature source (solar energy, oil furnace, nuclear reactor, etc.).
- ##convert part of this heat to work## (usually in the form of a rotating shaft).
- ##reject the remaining waste heat## to a low temperature sink (the atmosphere, rivers, etc.).
- operate on a cycle.

## 热力学第二定律 - 克劳修斯陈述 | The Second Law of Thermodynamics - Clausius Statement

It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of heat from a lower temperature body to a higher temperature body.

### 永动机 | Perpetual Motion Machines

## 可逆过程 | Reversible process

A reversible process a process that can be reversed without leaving any trace on the surroundings. Both the system and the surroundings are returned to their initial states at the end.

- Reversible process takes place only if the net heat and net work exchange between the system and surroundings is 0.
- Reversible processes actually do not occur in nature.

### 不可逆性 | Irreversibility

The factors that cause a process to be irreversible.

### 内部和外部的可逆过程 | Internally and Externally Reversible Processes

- A process is called internally reversible if no irreversibilities occur ##within## the boundaries of the system during the process.
- A process is called externally reversible if no irreversibilities occur ##outside## the system boundaries during the process.
- A process is called totally reversible, or simply reversible, if it involves ##no irreversibilities within the system or its surroundings##.

### 卡诺定理 | Carnot Principles

1. 所有不可逆的热机，其热效率会比使用相同高温和低温热源的卡诺热机要低 | The efficiency of an irreversible heat engine is always less than the efficiency of a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs.
2. 所有可逆的热机，其热效率会等于相同高温和低温热源的卡诺热机 | The efficiencies of all reversible heat engines operating between the same two reservoirs are the same.

### 卡诺热机效率 | Carnot Heat Engine

任意热机的热效率 (thermal efficiency): 

$$$
\eta _{th} = 1 - Q_L / Q_H
$$$

Q,,H,, is heat transferred to the heat engine from a high-temperature reservoir at T,,H,,, and Q,,L,, is heat rejected to a low-temperature reservoir at T,,L,,.

对于可逆的热机：$$Q_L / Q_H = T_L / T_H$$
所以 $$\eta _{th, rev} = 1 - T_L / T_H$$

卡诺热机效率：$$\eta _{th} = \frac{Q_H - Q_L}{Q_H} = 1 - \frac{Q_L}{Q_H} = $$``$$1 - \frac{T_L}{T_H}$$``

## 例题1

The food compartment of a ##refrigerator## is maintained at 4°C by removing heat from it at a rate of 360 kJ/min. If the required power input to the refrigerator is 2 kW, determine
(a) the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator and 
(b) the rate of heat rejection to the room that houses the refrigerator.

(a) 使用冰箱的效率系数公式 $$COP_R = \frac{Q_L}{W_{net, in}}$$,
本题中，$$Q_L = 360 kJ/min = 6 kW, W_{net, in} = 2kW$$,
所以 $$COP_R = \frac{Q_L}{W_{net, in}} = 3$$
(b) $$Q_H = Q_L + W_{net, in} = 8 kW$$

## 例题2

A ##heat pump## is used to meet the heating requirements of a house and maintainit at 20°C. On a day when the outdoor air temperature drops to -2°C,the house is estimated to lose heat at a rate of 80,000 kJ/h. If the heat pump under these conditions has a COP of 2.5, determine 
(a) the power consumed by the heat pump
(b) the rate at which heat is absorbed from the cold outdoor air.

(a) 由题目热量流失速度可知，$$Q_H = 80000 kJ/h$$
又知 $$COP = 2.5$$，由公式 $$COP_{HP} = \frac{Q_H}{W_{net, in}}$$,
$$$
W_{net, in} = \frac{Q_H}{COP}
$$$
(b) $$Q_L = Q_H - W_{net, in}$$

## 例题3

A Carnot heat engine receives 500 kJ of heat per cycle from a high-temperature source at 652 ℃ and rejects heat to a low-temperature sink at 30 ℃. 
Determine:
(a) the thermal efficiency of this Carnot engine
(b) the amount of heat rejected to the sink per cycle.

![例题3图示](.热力学第二定律/例题3图示.png)

(a) 直接应用卡诺热机效率公式 $$\eta _{th} = 1 - \frac{T_L}{T_H}$$。注意⚠️要将温度转化为开尔文温标（加上 273）进行计算。
(b) the amount of heat rejected 即求 $$Q_L$$。
由卡诺热机效率公式 $$\eta _{th} = 1 - \frac{Q_L}{Q_H}$$
可得 $$Q_L = Q_H (1 - \eta _{th})$$

## 例题4

A heat pump is to heat a house during the winter. The house is to be maintained at 21℃ at all times. The house is estimated to be losing heat at a rate of 135,000 kJ/h when the outside temperature drops to -5°C. 
Determine the minimum power required to drive this heat pump.

$$Q_H = 135000 kJ/h = 37.5 kW$$
由公式 $$COP_{HP, rev} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_L}$$ 可算出该热泵的热效率
再用公式 $$W_{net, in} = \frac{Q_H}{COP_{HP, rev}}$$ 可得答案。
