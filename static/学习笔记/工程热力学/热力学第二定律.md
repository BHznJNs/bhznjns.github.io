# 热力学第二定律 | Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics asserts that processes occur in a certain direction and that energy has quality as well as quantity.

## 热机 | Heat Engines

Converting ##heat to work## requires special devices called heat engines.

- ##receive heat## from a high temperature source (solar energy, oil furnace, nuclear reactor, etc.).
- ##convert part of this heat to work## (usually in the form of a rotating shaft).
- ##reject the remaining waste heat## to a low temperature sink (the atmosphere, rivers, etc.).
- operate on a cycle.
