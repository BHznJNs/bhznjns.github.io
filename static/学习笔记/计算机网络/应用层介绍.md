# 应用层介绍

## Application architectures

### client-server (C/S) or browser-server (B/S)

server:
- always-on host
- permanent IP address
- data centers for scaling

clients:
- communicate with server
- may be intermittently connected
- may have dynamic IP addresses
- do not communicate directly with each other

### peer-to-peer (P2P)

- no always-on server
- self scalability – new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands

## Sockets & IP address

A socket acts as a "door" or interface between an application process and the end-to-end transport protocol (like TCP or UDP).
An IP address is a 32-bit identifier for a host or router interface.

### Transport protocols

| Protocols          | TCP                                     | UDP                      |
| Reliability        | reliable transport                      | unreliable data transfer |
| Flow control       | sender won’t overwhelm receiver         | Not provided            |
| Congestion control | throttle sender when network overloaded | Not provided            |
