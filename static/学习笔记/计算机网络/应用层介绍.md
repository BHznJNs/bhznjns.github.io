## Application architectures

### client-server (C/S) or browser-server (B/S)

server:
- always-on host
- permanent IP address
- data centers for scaling

clients:
- communicate with server
- may be intermittently connected
- may have dynamic IP addresses
- do not communicate directly with each other

### peer-to-peer (P2P)

- no always-on server
- self scalability – new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
