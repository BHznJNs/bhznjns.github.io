# 电路理论导入 | Introduction

## 三个假设前提 | Three Assumptions

1. electrical effects happen ##instantaneously## throughout the system.
2. We assume that the net charge on every component in the system is always zero.
3. We assume that there is no magnetic coupling between the components of a system.

## 电荷 | Charge

q Coulomb (C)

## 电流 | Current

Flow of electric charge in a conductor

i = dq / dt

Unit: Ampere (A)

## 电压 | Voltage

This potential energy difference per charge.

v = dw / dq

Unit: Volt (V)

## 电阻 | Resistance

$$$
R = v / i\\

Unit: \Omega (Ohm)
$$$

### 电阻率 | Resistivity

$$$
R = \rho L / A\\

Unit: \Omega m
$$$

## 电导 | Conductance

电阻的倒数 | The reciprocal of the resistance.

G = 1 / R

Unit: siemens(S)
