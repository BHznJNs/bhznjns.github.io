# 电功率，电能和理想电源 | Power, Energy, Ideal Sources

## 电功率 | Power

p = dw / dt = vi = v''2'' / R = i''2''R

Unit: Watt (W)

## 理想电压 / 电流源 | Ideal Voltage / Current Sources

### The Ideal Voltage Source

An ideal voltage source is an ideal circuit element that ##maintains a prescribed voltage## across its terminals at all times, regardless of the current flowing in those terminals.

### The Ideal Current Source

An ideal current source is an ideal circuit element that maintains a prescribed current through its terminals at all times, regardless of the voltage across those terminals.

## 直流电路 | Direct Current (DC) Circuits

The currents and voltages remain constant everywhere.

## 开路 | The open circuit

An ideal current source with a value equal to zero is a device that ##has 0 A of current## on it. In other words, it doesn’t pass any current, no matter how large or how small the voltage ``v`` is. (电流恒等于零)
It is equivalent to an open circuit.

## 短路 | The short circuit

An ideal voltage source with a value equal to zero is a device that ##has 0 V of voltage## on it, no matter how large or how small the voltage v is. (电压恒等于零)
It is equivalent to a piece of perfect conductor, also called a short circuit.
